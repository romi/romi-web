These farms grow a large number of vegetables, up to a hundred varieties, every season. Because of this complexity, most of the planting out, weeding, and harvesting is performed manually. This work is quite physical and time consuming. The ROMI project looks at how new technologies can aid these farmers. The solutions must be adapted to the constraints imposed by these farms (small size, many different crops, lower investment capacity). The ROMI project therefore proposes technologies that are inexpensive, light-weight, and adaptable."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We are looking both at concrete technologies for short-term applications as well as research for more long-term requirements.
