        <h2>About</h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class="m-5">
        <p>ROMI is a four-year Europe-funded research project
          committed to promote a sustainable, local, and human-scale
          agriculture. The goal is to develop an open-source,
          affordable, multipurpose platform adapted to support organic
          and poly-culture market-garden farms.</p>
        
        <p>Small, diversified vegetable farms have an important role
          to play in sustainable food production. Installed close to
          cities, they provide healthy vegetables at accessible prices
          through short supply chains. They contribute to the
          biodiversity in peri-urban areas and re-establish the missing
          link between urban and rural areas.</p>
        
        <p>The Robotics for Microfarms project (ROMI) looks at the use
          of new technology, including robotics, AI, and advanced
          modeling, to assist these farms.</p>

        <p>The sizes of the farms that we are addressing are between
          1000 m² and five hectares. These farms grow a large number of
          vegetables, up to a hundred varieties, every season. Because
          of this complexity, most of the planting out, weeding, and
          harvesting is performed manually. This work is quite physical
          and time consuming. The ROMI project looks at how new
          technologies can aid these farmers. The solutions must be
          adapted to the constraints imposed by these farms (small size,
          many different crops, lower investment capacity). The ROMI
          project therefore proposes technologies that are inexpensive,
          light-weight, and adaptable.</p>

        <p>We are looking both at concrete technologies for short-term
          applications as well as research for more long-term
          requirements. In the short term, we look at automatic weeding
          and crop monitoring for more precise crop planning. In the
          longer term, we deal with 3D imaging and modeling of
          individual plants for detailed plant health analysis and
          selective plant breeding. We also look into adative robotics
          so that our tools can deal gracefully with the complex,
          time-varying, in-field conditions.</p>
        
        <p>The ROMI technologies are available under an Open Source
          license in the hope of reaching as many microfarms as
          possible. We are currently targeting the European microfarms
          but we keep in mind that worldwide there are over 500 million
          small-holder farms that could benefit from our work. </p>
